# VibeCheck

## Overview
**VibeCheck** is a natural language processing application designed to summarize text and analyze its sentiment. By leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models, this tool allows users to quickly gain insights from longer passages of text and understand the underlying sentiment—whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Condenses lengthy texts into concise summaries using the `T5 model`.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies the sentiment of the text or its summary as positive, negative, or neutral using `DistilBERT`.
